# Introduction
This project was the final part of a VLSI Design class I took in the spring of 2024. Each group of 3â€“4 students was tasked with designing the schematic and physical layout of an 8-bit microprocessor data path, including an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), a barrel shifter, and a register file, using CMOS circuitry and Cadence VLSI design tools. The completed projects were judged based on speed, minimization of area, number of operations and difficulty of the operation set. A panel of Intel representatives and our course professor served as judges, with the top team receiving the Intel Outstanding Project Award. 

I had the privilege of working with two like-minded teammates, and together, we developed a design we were extremely proud of. We secured a close second place, ultimately edged out by a team with a more ambitious operation set. Our final design came out being quite compact, while also beating the timing requirements set out by the instructors. Early on in the project we decided to split the project into the main components, with each of us taking a component and architecting it from start to finish. We were able to work together really well, with lots of communication throughout the entire design process, leading to our components meshing together well when we brought them together for integration. You can see the results of our collaboration in the complete data path layout seen below.
