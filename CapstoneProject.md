#Project Overview

This project involved designing and building an automated phosphate sensing system for water quality monitoring. The system was designed to measure phosphate concentration using a chemical reaction, photodetection, and calibration.

System Design & Components

The system consisted of three main components:

1. Automated Dispensing Mechanism

Used for mixing water samples with reagents.

Controlled by an Arduino to ensure precise liquid handling.

2. Photodetection Design

A photodiode was used to measure light intensity changes resulting from the reaction.

Data was collected and stored using an SD card module.

3. Calibration & Data Processing

The system was calibrated using known phosphate concentrations.

Data was processed to determine the phosphate concentration in test samples.

Implementation

Hardware Development

Components: Arduino, photodiode, peristaltic pumps, SD card module, and LED light source.

Electronics were wired to automate sample mixing and detection.



Software & Data Collection

An Arduino program controlled reagent dispensing and data logging.

The system paused for data offloading and restarted upon command.

// Sample Arduino code snippet for data logging
void loop() {
    int sensorValue = analogRead(A0);
    Serial.println(sensorValue);
    delay(1000);
}

Calibration & Testing

A series of known phosphate concentrations were tested to create a calibration curve.

The photodiode readings were plotted to determine accuracy.



Results & Findings

The system successfully detected phosphate concentrations within an expected range.

Some challenges included precise reagent dispensing and external light interference.

Future Improvements

Improving the accuracy of the dispensing system.

Enhancing noise reduction in photodetection.

Integrating wireless data transmission for remote monitoring.

Conclusion

This project demonstrated a low-cost, automated approach to phosphate sensing using an Arduino-based system. The prototype provided valuable insights into water quality monitoring solutions.
