# Introduction
This project involved the fabrication and analysis of microelectronic devices as a hands-on component of a microelectronic fabrication course. The goal was to process a silicon wafer through a series of standard semiconductor manufacturing steps to create a number of functional devices. Following fabrication, the devices were measured and compared to theoretical predictions to evaluate the impact of process variations on device performance. This analysis provided valuable insights into how fabrication conditions influence the electrical properties of microelectronic components.

# Fabrication Steps
I wanted to walk through a number of the steps that our wafers underwent as we processed them. For the analysis stage of the project I chose to measure and do calculations for the mosfets we created so I'll use them as an example later to show each step in a little more detail. We used a number of standard processes while creating our devices including photolithography, wet etching, thermal oxidation, metal deposition, and diffusion doping.

Using the mosfet as an example I've drawn up a step by step walkthrough of how we processed the wafers.

# Results/Analysis
As we processed the wafers through each step we did a number of calculations related to that step. So we knew expected device parameters like gate oxide thickness based on oxidation time, junction depth based on drive in time, and gate dimensions based on the masks. Using these parameters the expected electrical characteristics of the device can be found and a family of curves generated. Then after measuring the actual device we can compare the observed results with the expected results and do analysis. Can see that it is different in x, y and z ways. Working theory is that variations in high temperature processes affected parameters like junction depth, gate thickness etc. also possibly variations in etch time as they were etched as a batch so some may be over or underetched. End result is that real device differs from theoretical device. See graphs below. Maybe also some equations.

As a quick bonus, during one of labs the mercury vapor bulb used for exposing photoresist in the mask aligner we used exploded. Because this was the only mask aligner in the engineering building we had to move subsequent labs to the engineering research complex where they have a clean room! Normally the clean room is used only for research and graduate level courses so we would not normally get to work in it but because of the mishap we were allowed to use it. It was a super cool experience! I never dreamed I would get to work in an environment like that and as a bonus I got to keep the clean room bunny suit they gave us! Also It was really cool to get to see the machines we had learned about in class and get more detailed explanations of those processes, Chemical vapor deposition and Electron-beam physical vapor deposition are such cool technologies, they are almost like a form of sorcery!

**Me suited up and ready for some clean room action:**
