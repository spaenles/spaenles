# My Projects
Hello again! Here are some of the things I've worked on over the last few years that I'm proud of and think are neat. Some of them are work done for classes at MSU and others were done in my free time.
## Automated Phosphate Sensing System
This was a group project done in my last semester at MSU as part of a capstone design class. Our task was to design and build a complete system for automated phospate detection in water samples. The system utilizes an arduino to control a number of pumps and sensors to collect a sample, mix it with a chemical reagent, measure the resulting color change, and determine the amount of phosphate present in the sample.

## Design and Characterization of an 8-Bit Microprocessor Data Path
This project was the final assignment for my VLSI Design course in Spring 2024, where my team designed and implemented the schematic and physical layout of an 8-bit microprocessor data path using Cadence tools. Our design included an ALU, barrel shifter, and register file, optimized for speed and area efficiency. We secured second place in the competition, judged by Intel representatives and our professor, with my primary contribution being the design and layout of the shifter module.

## Fabrication of Microelectronic Devices on a Silicon Wafer
This project involved fabricating and analyzing a variety of devices on a silicon wafer as the practical component of a microelectronic fabrication course. Post-fabrication, device characteristics were measured and compared to analytical predictions, with discrepancies analyzed to determine their possible causes. This analysis provided insight into how fabrication conditions affect electrical properties in microelectronic devices. [Interested?](Microelectronics_Fabrication.md)

## Custom 2-Axis Joystick
I got into flight simulators several years ago and decided it would be neat to design and make my own custom joystick, as a bonus maybe I could save a few dollars too... Many hours later, and after spending more on a new 3D printer and components than I would have on a new joystick, I had my very own one of a kind toy! I have since put some time into making a V2 but haven't gotten around to finishing that.

## Anti-Theft Cat Bowl
This is a very much in progress project I've been working on on and off for about a year. The idea is to make a device that can hold within itself a cat bowl, or cat food, and then open only when a specific cat approaches. The motivation for this arises from my partner's two cats, one of whom enjoys food a little too much and will often steal food from his shy little brother. At the moment I am investigating using an ESP32 to detect the proximity of a BLE beacon that will be attached to the authorized cat and open a door when that cat gets within a certain range...
