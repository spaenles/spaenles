# My Projects
Hello again! Here are some of the things I've worked on over the last few years that I'm proud of and think are neat. Some of them are work done for classes at MSU and others were done in my free time. Please forgive the fact that these are not all complete! I am trying to get them filled out as quickly as possible!

## Automated Phosphate Sensing System
This was a group project done in my last semester at MSU as part of a capstone design class. Our task was to design and build a complete system for automated phospate detection in water samples. The system utilizes an arduino to control a number of pumps and sensors to collect a sample, mix it with a chemical reagent, measure the resulting color change, and determine the amount of phosphate present in the sample.

## Custom 2-Axis Joystick
I got into flight simulators several years ago and decided it would be neat to design and make my own custom joystick, as a bonus maybe I could save a few dollars too... Many hours later, and after spending more on a new 3D printer and components than I would have on a new joystick, I had my very own one of a kind toy! I have since put some time into making a V2 but haven't gotten around to finishing that. You can see more about that [here]().

## Anti-Theft Cat Bowl
This is a very much in progress project I've been working on on and off for about a year. The idea is to make a device that can hold within itself a cat bowl, or cat food, and then open only when a specific cat approaches. The motivation for this arises from my partner's two cats, one of whom enjoys food a little too much and will often steal food from his shy little brother. At the moment I am investigating using an ESP32 to detect the proximity of a BLE beacon that will be attached to the authorized cat and open a door when that cat gets within a certain range...
